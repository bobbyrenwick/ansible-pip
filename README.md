An ansible role that ensures pip is installed at the version you specify.
It uses `get-pip.py` to install pip.

- `pip_version` specifies which version of pip you want to install.
  - Defaults to `None`, to install the latest version (If pip is installed, upgrades to the latest pip version available)
  - Can be set to a specific verion, e.g. `"6.0.8"` to force installation of that version.
